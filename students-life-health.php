The department of psychology is in charge of prevention and intervention techniques  in situations related to human behaviour. Progress is achieved through an interdisciplinary approach between teachers, coordinators, parents and external therapists.
We provide a variety of programs and prevention strategies such as:<br>
<br>
1.- Values program K - 6th<br>
2.- Educational orientation program (Kinder)<br>
3.- Positive discipline program<br>
4.- Red Ribbon Week <br>
<br>
 These programs are intended to offer guidance, information and to assist the child by developing conflict resolution skills which can be applied in everyday situations. 
The therapists observes, documents and informs how each child is developing social, academic and emotional skills throughout his academic development. Our department has a conflict resolution model that is applied at all levels starting preschool. This model provides guidelines for the students to look for solutions and empower them in daily situations. ' ),
