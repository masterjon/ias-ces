                <p>I now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. well, what is it today? more spelunking? you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks.
