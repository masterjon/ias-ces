  'content'=>'<p>One of the most important aspects of planning for a university career is developing a budget well in advance. Have a very honest conversation with your parents about exactly how much they are willing to pay for your education. You need a specific number. Be aware that if you are not a US citizen or permanent resident, you cannot qualify for Federal Financial Aid in the US. However, anyone can qualify for institutional money. The college that you are applying to has its own funds. Fill out the paperwork, and they will tell you if youve qualified for institutional money.</p>
  			  <p>Do not think of the number your parents come up with as the maximum tuition/ fees/books/room and board amount that you should look for when you re applying to schools. For example, your parents can only pay $30,000, and you want to apply to a school. Having only $14,000, doesn t rule out the possibility of going to that school! Financial aid is often available and you might be able to make it work. It depends entirely on the school.</p>
  			  <p>Be honest when you are completing the paperwork. Hiding assets can work against you. Also, know that they aren t going to expect your family to contribute all their money to paying for college. Colleges know that your parents have to continue paying the bills, saving for retirement, saving for your little brother to go to college, etc.</p>
  			  <h4>Scholarships and Financial Aid</h4>
  			  <p>Many schools in the U.S. and in other countries provide scholarships and financial assistance for students, but the country of citizenship usually affects the amount of aid available. There are some schools in the U.S. that guarantee to meet financial need of foreign students, and there are some schools in other countries that offer full scholarships to select students</p>
  			  <p>U.S. citizens apply to colleges and universities for need-based financial aid through FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Although the application cannot be submitted to universities until January 1 of the last year of high school, you can begin the process a couple of months before by applying for a pin and filling out worksheets available on the website. The pin is necessary to submit the application electronically, and both you and your parent(s) need a pin. Some federal money is also available for U.S. citizens to use at Canadian universities</p>
  			  <p>Most schools require additional documentation of financial need, usually including income tax records (from the U.S., Mexico, or another country) and statements of assets.</p>
  			  <p><b>Useful Links:</b><br>http://www.profileonline.collegeboard.com The CSS/PROFILE is an online form, provided by the College Board. Many schools ask applicants to complete the CSS/PROFILE as a part of their financial aid application. Many of the member colleges, universities, graduate and professional schools, and scholarship programs use theinformation collected on PROFILE to help them award nonfederal student aid funds.</p>
