Middle and high school students have access to it on a regular basis. Primary and kindergarten students are 

required to bring their own lunch. However, the cafeteria does offer a “box lunch“ for them, which is brought 

right before lunch time. Parents must call ahead to order and pay directly at the cafeteria. </p>
<p>
Friday is the only day when the cafeteria sets up in the kindergarten and primary building. Students may 

bring money to purchase a snack or treat.
